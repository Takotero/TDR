# TDR
Simple front-end web that calculates and vector draws orbits using mainly the canvas hmtl tag that is filled pixel by pixel by a bruteforce javascript script.
The user can input custom variables or choose presets form a dropdown menu.

**Disclaimer**: I wrote this web for my bachelor's end project and it was one of my first programig projects so don't expect clean or optimized code.
